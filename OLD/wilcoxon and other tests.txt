wilcox.test(A[,2],B[,2])

	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

W = 1913.5, p-value = 0.02169
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

> median(A[,2])
[1] 48
> median(B[,2])
[1] 52

It is statistically significant, there are more variants in DCM, the median is 4 variants more.
